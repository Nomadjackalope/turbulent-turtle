Not a complete solution but a good one. I would have to use three.js to really do this properly I think.

//---- VARIABLES ----

Task - Name, start-time, end-time, taskId

Array of tasks


//---- DIV CLASSES ----

day

halfHour

//---- DIV ID ----

task id


//---- GRID ----

Create Grid - large vertical divs filled with horizontal divs that respond to clicks.

Display current timeLine - create SVG line that fills vertical divs?

on click-create - new task object with start time & set freshTask = true;
on click-hold - update time of task object
on click-release - set editable text in new task = true & add task to array of tasks

on Enter pressed - if(freshTask) {freshTask = !freshTask & task name set to text & arrow to end time & checkTasks()} 

on text entered - place suggestion as end of word? place suggestion in div below start time
	& get suggestion from array of tasks
	
checkTasks() { forall(taskArray) {if name == taskArray(x).name then taskId = taskArray(x).taskId}

//---- TASKLIST ----

Create Tasklist - thin vertical div placed on left that displays the array of tasks

on click - highlights all tasks with that name blue
